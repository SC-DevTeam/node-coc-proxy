COC Proxy with the latest encryption! Cheers

* Required patched apk using SCDevTeam patcher: https://github.com/SC-DevTeam/coc-patcher
* Additional instructions on usage can be found here: https://github.com/royale-proxy/node-cr-proxy

# TODO
* Actually it logs decrypted payloads in hexadecimal. Would be cool to add the messages definitions into the project tree
